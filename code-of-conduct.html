    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>

    <p>A primary goal of Pixel Punch is to be inclusive to
    the largest number of contributors, with the most varied
    and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>

    <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all
    those who participate in our community, as well as the
    consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>

    <p>We invite all those who participate in Pixel Punch to
    help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

    <h2>2.‎ ‏Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>

    <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to
    increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships
    between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>

    <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>

    <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to
    ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>

    <h2>3.‎ ‏Expected Behavior</h2>

      <p>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</p>
      <p>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</p>
      <p>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</p>
      <p>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</p>
      <p>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>

    <h2>4.‎ ‏Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

    <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

    <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <h2>5.‎ ‏Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

    <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including
    sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

    <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to
    comply immediately.</p>

    <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem
    appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or
    permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

    <h2>6.‎ ‏If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

    <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or
    have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Reach Pixel Punch organizers at pixelpunch [at] voxmedia.com.</p>

    <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help
    community members engage with local law enforcement or to
    otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing
    distress.</p>

    <h2>7.‎ ‏Addressing Grievances</h2>

    <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of
    violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify
    Ally Palanzi with a concise description of your grievance.</p>

    <h2>8.‎ ‏Scope</h2>

    <p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or
    otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this
    Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-
    person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>
